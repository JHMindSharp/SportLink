# SportLink

## Introduction
**SportLink** is a web application designed to connect amateur athletes and facilitate the organization of sporting activities. Whether you’re looking for a partner to train with, a place to exercise, or tools to track your progress, SportLink has you covered.

This project was developed as part of my portfolio for Holberton School and serves as an example of my full-stack development skills.
